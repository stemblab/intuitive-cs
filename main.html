  <h2 class="pz_section" id="overview" ref="slide_overview">Overview</h2>

  CS is a tale of two 
  <span class="pz_text" ref="coordinates_note">coordinate
  systems</span>---of the same signal expressed in different ways
  (mathematically, according to different bases).  According to one
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra),basis] the
  coordinates are sparse (have <span class="pz_text"
  ref="coefficients_note">coefficients</span> with at least one zero).
  According to the other basis the coordinates are compressible (have
  redundant coefficients that may be dropped).  The promise of CS is
  that the compressed coordinates---that is, with the redundant
  coefficients omitted---take less bandwidth to transmit (fewer bits
  to store, etc.).

  <div class="pz_note" id="coordinates_note">
    A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinate_system, coordinate
    system] uses a tuple of numbers to locate or describe something.
    Following [books.google.co.nz/books?isbn=0898714540, Meyer] any
    vector can be expressed as a
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination,linear
    combination] of basis vectors, and the coefficients in that sum
    are collectively known as the __coordinates__.  Obviously, the
    coordinates depend on the basis.
  </div>

  <div class="pz_note" id="coefficients_note">
    Any vector may be expressed as a
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination, linear
    combination] of basis vectors.  The mulitplier of each vector in
    that sum is the __coefficient__ with respect to that basis element
    ([books.google.co.nz/books?isbn=0898714540,see Meyer]).
    Collectively the coefficients are known as the __coordinates__.
  </div>

  For the polynomial riddle the 
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_introduction">
    constant, line and parabola</span> are all versions of a signal
  $f(t)=x_0+x_1 t+ x_2 t^2$, where only one of $x_0$, $x_1$ or $x_2$
  is not zero (we don't know which!).  Thus, $[x_0~x_1~x_2]^T$ are
  sparse coordinates for $f(t)$ (according to the basis
  $\mathcal{B}_N=\{1,t,t^2\}$).

  The red, blue and green sample values---say $[b_0~b_1~b_2]^T$---of
  $f(t)$ are a <span class="pz_text" ref="sampling_basis_note">second
  set of coordinates</span> according to a second basis of polynomials
  (<span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_twobases_2">discussed
  later</span>).  If we can use fewer coordinates (e.g.,
  $[b_0~b_2]^T$) and still recover $[x_0~x_1~x_2]^T$ then $f(t)$ has
  been
  <span class="pz_text" ref="sensing_note">successfully compressed.</span>

  <div class="pz_note" id="sampling_basis_note">
    While obvious to some, the idea that a signal's samples are also
    its coordinates according to some basis may cause others to
    stumble.  If you're familiar with [TBD, Whittaker-Shannon
    interpolation], think of the basis signals as the shifted "sinc"
    functions, so that only one basis signal is non-zero at each
    sampling instant. Whenever this is true (not just for sinc
    interpolation) then the sample values themselves form the
    coordinates of the signal.

  <div class="pz_note" id="sensing_note">
    This is different from other methods of compression, where the
    entire set of samples is processed and compressed to a smaller
    set. Here the compression takes place along with the measurement
    (e.g., dropping a sample). However, later we will see that CS
    often involves taking weighted combinations of samples, in which
    case the distinction is less clear.
  </div>

  We first solve the polynomial riddle with everyday logic.  The
  remaining sections use the riddle as a launchpad---extending the
  kernel of this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toy_problem, toy
  problem] towards more general, and useful, ideas.

  <h2 class="pz_section" id="solving" 
      ref="slide_solving">Solving the Riddle</h2>

  Taken together, three samples identify *any* second order
  polynomial.  That is, given almost any three points, the second
  order polynomial that passes through all of them is
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation#
  Uniqueness_of_the_interpolating_polynomial,unique].  Collectively
  then, the red, blue and green samples are sufficient to identify the
  riddle's secret signal. But, can we do better?

  Certainly one sample is not enough; since all the signals can
  <span class="pz_text" ref="one_sample_note">agree on any one sample
    value</span> (for some choice of $x_0$, $x_1$ and $x_2$) they are
  impossible to distinguish.  In other words, with a single sample
  there are many possible
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing,aliases].  Aliases are
  signals that are equal at the sampling instants but differ
  elsewhere.

  <div class="pz_note" id="one_sample_note">
    For example, say the parabola has value $p$ at the first sampling instant.
    The constant aliases the parabola if $x_0=p$.
  </div>

  Similarly, for two samples, if two different signals (the line and
  parabola say) agree at both sampling instants they are aliases---it
  is impossible to tell which signal was secretly chosen.  For
  example, choosing the blue and green samples, the line and parabola
  agree whenever $x_1=2x_2$ and so these samples do not solve the
  riddle.  We could not know with certainty the chosen signal using
  the blue and green samples---and the red and blue samples are ruled
  out on similar grounds.

  However, <span class="pz_text" ref="line_parabola_note">no line and
    parabola can __ever__ agree at the red and green samples</span>.
    Also, <span style="pz_text"
    ref="constant_line_parabola_note">neither the line nor parabola
    can ever agree with the constant</span>.  Therefore, the constant,
    line and parabola can *always* be identified with the red and
    green samples---given red and green samples we can always tell
    which signal was chosen (and determine $x_0$, $x_1$ or $x_2$).
    The answer to our introductory challenge is thus: the red and
    green samples are sufficient to choose between the constant, line
    and parabola.

  <div class="pz_note" id="line_parabola_note">
    The line and parabola have different signs at the red and green samples.
  </div>

  <div class="pz_note" id="constant_line_parabola_note">
    The constant and line have different signs at the red and green
    samples.  The constant and parabola have the same sign, but the
    values of the parabola are always different (and the values of the
    constant are always the same).
  </div>

  <h2 class="pz_section" id="significance" 
      ref="slide_significance">Significance of the Riddle</h2>

  Before delving into the detail in later sections, let's first
  broadly consider what can be learned from the polynomial riddle.

  <h4>Compression & Sparsity</h4>

  The highest order signal, the parabola, suggests that three samples
  are *sufficient* to identify $f(t)$.  Indeed, if nothing else is
  known about $f(t)$ three samples are * necessary *.  However, a
  two-sample solution illustrates two important points: (1)
  __compressed__ coordinates exist for $f(t)$; (2) it was
  the <span class="pz_text" ref="known_sparsity_note">__known__
  sparsity that allowed the compression</span>.

  <div class="pz_note" id="known_sparsity_note">
    In solving the riddle, the pivotal issue was whether any
    __single__ signal (constant, line or parabola) could be mistaken
    for any other.  We were not concerned with __combinations__ of
    signals---and if we were, the answer to the riddle would be "all
    three samples".
  </div>

  <h4>K-Sparse Aliases</h4>

  Preventing aliases was the key to the solution---but not just any
  aliases.  There had to be <span class="pz_text"
  ref="no_1sparse_note">no 1-sparse aliases</span>.  That is, we could
  not allow two __individual__ signals to agree at the sampling
  instants.  However, if a __combination__ of a constant and a line
  agree with the parabola---who cares?  2-sparse aliases (combinations
  of the constant, line and parabola) are outside the realm of the
  riddle.  The K-sparse alias will be a pivotal idea below.

  <div class="pz_note" id="no_1sparse_note">
    Only 1-sparse signals (constants, lines OR parabolas) are valid in
    the riddle.  Therefore, we are only concerned with 1-sparse aliases.
    2-sparse aliases (combinations of signals) do not concern us.
  </div>

  <h4>Polynomials</h4>

  Studying polynomials is less limiting than it may seem because
  periodic signals are
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_polynomial,
  trigonometric polynomials] (i.e., polynomials defined on a complex
  circle).  In that context, the sparse coordinates (sparse polynomial
  coefficients) correspond to a <span class="pz_text"
  ref="frequency_sparse_note">sparse frequency representation</span>.

  <div class="pz_note" id="frequency_sparse_note">
    For example, the band-limited signals found in mobile
    communications.
  </div>

  <h4>Sub-Nyquist Sampling</h4>

  With a <span class="pz_text" ref="abuse_note">minor abuse of
    terminology</span>, three samples are the
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_rate,Nyquist rate] for
  second order polynomials.  Compressive sampling allows sub-Nyquist
  sampling of sparse signals.  If this seems surprising (even
  blasphemous), this will evaporate once you understand just what a
  tight constraint sparsity imposes on the signal.  Sub-Nyquist
  sampling is possible only if we agree to constrain the family of
  possible signals.

  <div class="pz_note" id="abuse_note">
    Minor, because it is the correct term for __trigonometric__ polynomials.
  </div>

  <h4>Change of Basis</h4>

  The key to CS is a pair of bases---one basis for which the signal's
  coordinates are sparse and one basis for which the coordinates are
  redundant (has coefficients that can be discarded).  Such a
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_of_basis, change of basis] is
  an idea shared with venerable compression technologies such as
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG,JPEG] (Strang's
  [http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/
  video-lectures/lecture-31-change-of-basis-image-compression/,lecture]
  on changes of basis and image compression inspired this treatment of
  CS).

  <h2 class="pz_section" id="two_important_bases" 
      ref="slide_twobases_1">Two Important Bases</h2>

  The <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_introduction">polynomial
    signal</span> $f(t)=x_0+x_1t+x_2t^2$ has the "natural" basis
    $\mathcal{B}_N=\{1,t,t^2\}$---with coefficients $x_0$, $x_1$ and
    $x_2$.  For our polynomial riddle $\mathcal{B}_N$ is also a
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_twobases_1">sparsity
  basis</span> because only one of $x_0$, $x_1$ and $x_2$ is not zero.
  For CS, the sparsity basis is one of two important bases.  The
  second we will call the
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_twobases_2">sensing basis</span>.

  The coordinates according to the sensing basis (the *sensing
  coordinates*) are obtained by <span class="pz_text"
  ref="observations_note">directly observing</span> the signal.  For
  the polynomial riddle the sensing coordinates are the __values__ of
  the signal at the sampling instants (i.e., the sample values).  The
  actual sensing basis consists of three polynomials, each of which is
  unity at one sampling instant and zero at the other sampling
  instants (i.e., [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial,
  Lagrange polynomials]).

  <div class="pz_note" id="observations_note">
    For example, observing the sample values.  Or, in more advanced
    treatments, linear combinations of sample values.
  </div>

  While the Lagrange polynomials are the most 
  <span class="pz_text" ref="obvious_choice_note">obvious
    choice</span> of sensing basis they are far from the only choice.
    We might entertain (purely for example) a sensing basis for which
    the coefficients are the
  <span class="pz_text" ref="mean_samples_note">mean of adjacent
    sample values</span>.  Such freedom to choose the sensing basis is
    an important aspect of CS (why "Compressed __Sensing__" is a
    better name than "Compressed
    __Sampling__")---<span class="pz_text" ref="other_bases_note">but
    we don't need it here</span>.  Sensing coordinates equal to the
    sample values are enough.

  <div class="pz_note" id="obvious_choice_note">
    Obvious, because the coefficients are just the sample values of
    the signal.
  </div>

  <div class="pz_note" id="mean_samples_note">
    More generally, some
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_combination, linear
    combination] of samples.
  </div>

  <div class="pz_note" id="other_bases_note">
    See <a href="/?id=b0080" target="_blank">Compressive Sensing
      Primer</a> for other sensing bases.
  </div>

  The whole point of the sensing basis is that with cunning
  configuration (say by selection of sampling instants, which we
  consider), or even combinations of sample values
  (<span class="pz_text" ref="other_coords_note">which we
  don't</span>) not all of the sensing coefficients are required to
  identify a sparse signal---some coefficients are __redundant__.
  Thus we call the sensing basis $\mathcal{B}_R$, and our next step is
  to show an intuitive, geometrical picture of the polynomial riddle.

  <div class="pz_note" id="other_coords_note">
    See <a href="/?id=b0080" target="_blank">Compressive Sensing
      Primer</a> for cases where the sample values are combined.

      ref="slide_sensing_coordinates_1">Sensing Coordinates</h2>

  <pzthumb src="./python/geom_3.svg" ref="slide_sensing_coordinates_3"/>

  It is helpful to visualize our signals in a three dimensional space
  (i.e., the ubiquitous <span class="pz_text" ref="sig_space_note">
  vector-as-an-arrow</span> scenario).  The three orthogonal axes
  correspond to the sensing coordinates---so, for instance, the
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_introduction">red, blue and
    green sample values</span> each get an axis (say the $b_0$, $b_1$
    and $b_2$ axes).

  <div class="pz_note" id="sig_space_note">
    For a gentle introduction see, for example, Haykin's
    [http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=BUkcAAAAQBAJ, Digital
    Communications]. Of course, if you prefer to substitute "vector"
    or "signal"---have at it.
  </div>

  In particular, we can represent the sparsity basis polynomials
  $\mathcal{B}_N=\{1,t,t^2\}$
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_sensing_coordinates_3">as
    vectors</span>.
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_sensing_coordinates_1">The
    constant</span>, $f(t)=1$, has coordinates $b_0=1$, $b_1=1$ and
    $b_2=1$ (or $[1~1~1]^T$ in matrix notation).
    Similarly, <span class="pz_slide_link"
    ref="slide_sensing_coordinates_2">the line</span> (with $f(t)=t$)
    and <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_sensing_coordinates_3">
    the parabola</span> (with $f(t)=t^2$) have coordinates
    $[-1~0~2]^T$ and $[1~0~4]^T$ respectively.

  This geometrical view will be invaluable below---first, let's
  preview why.  For the polynomial riddle we agree, from the outset,
  to consider only signals that are 1-sparse according to
  $\mathcal{B}_N=\{1,t,t^2\}$.  Therefore, for this problem, signals
  can *only* lie along the direction of
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_sensing_coordinates_3">the
    constant, the line or the parabola</span> in our three dimensional
  plot.  *No other signals exist in the world of this problem.*

This is a strong constraint! With three coordinates we can represent 
__any__ second order polynomial, so it's reasonable that fewer coordinates 
should be required when the signal is so rigidly constrained. 
CS is both much more than this idea (it is a very rich theory)
and entirely this idea (this is the heart of CS).

  <h2 class="pz_section" id="sparsity_basis" 
      ref="slide_sparsity_basis">Sparsity Basis Projections</h2>

  Given the constraint that every signal in the polynomial riddle must
  lie along the direction of
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_sensing_coordinates_3">the
    constant, the line or the parabola</span> our challenge is to find
  coordinates with fewer than three coefficients from which the
  original signal can be restored.  The core idea is to
  <span class="pz_text" ref="projection_note"> project</span> the
  signal onto a subspace (say a plane), which has fewer dimensions
  (and obviously fewer coefficients).  Then, use the signal's known
  sparsity to reconstruct the signal from its projection.

  <pzthumb src="./python/geom_4.svg" ref="slide_sparsity_basis"/>

  <div class="pz_note" id="projection_note">
    Projecting onto a plane amounts to finding the closest vector in
    the plane.  When the plane is orthogonal to an axis, the means
    simply dropping the coefficient of that axis.  Of course, it's
    trickier when the basis is not orthogonal, and the plane is skewed
    with the axes (see, e.g.,
    [http://books.google.co.nz/books?isbn=0898714540, Meyer] or
    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projection_(linear_algebra),wikipedia]).
  </div>

  For the subspace, consider 
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_sparsity_basis">a plane
    perpendicular to the $b_1$ axis</span> (i.e., perpendicular to
    $[0~1~0]^T$).  Now <span class="pz_slide_link"
    ref="slide_sparsity_basis">project the sparsity basis</span> (the
    constant, line and parabola) onto this plane.  It's helpful to
    have a name for these projections, so we'll call them
    $\mathcal{SB}$-projections ("SB" for sparsity basis).  Now, since
    every 1-sparse signal lies along the direction of the constant,
    the line or the parabola, the projection of every signal lies
    along the direction of one of the $\mathcal{SB}$-projections.

  A signal's projection is naturally compressed because it has fewer
  coordinates (just $b_0$ and $b_2$ in this case).  Furthermore,
  because each $\mathcal{SB}$-projection is distinct (has a different
  direction), different types of signals (constants, lines and
  parabolas) project to different parts of the plane.  Therefore,
  given any (1-sparse) signal's projection we can reconstruct the
  original signal by searching against all the
  $\mathcal{SB}$-projections until we
  <span class="pz_text" ref="sb_match_note">find a match</span> (when
  the signal's projection is a scaled version of a
  $\mathcal{SB}$-projection).

  <div class="pz_note" id="sb_match_note">
    In other words, the projection of every signal lies along the line
    of one of the <span class="pz_slide_link"
    ref="slide_sparsity_basis">yellow vectors</span>.  To recover the
    signal, we choose the $\mathcal{SB}$-projection (yellow vector)
    with which the signal's vector aligns.
  </div>

  Had we projected onto the plane orthogonal to the $b_0$ axis we'd
  have found that two $\mathcal{SB}$-projections---of the line and
  parabola---are co-linear (not distinct).  This means a line and
  parabola can be found that project to the same vector in the
  plane---i.e., that agree at the sampling instants, and are therefore
  1-sparse aliases.  Just as we found when choosing the green and blue
  samples above (and omitting the red $b_0$ sample) CS is
  unsuccessful, because there is no way to uniquely find the signal
  from which the projection originates.

  For the 1-sparse case in three dimensions the idea of "distinct"
  $\mathcal{S}$-projections is straightforward.  But the general
  $K$-sparse case in $N$ dimensions is less clear.  For this we need
  the idea of a $K$-sparse alias.  First though, we'll start by
  revisiting 1-sparse aliases in geometrical terms.

  <h2 class="pz_section" id="aliases" 
      ref="slide_aliases_1">K-Sparse Aliases</h2>

  <pzthumb src="./python/spark_1.svg" ref="slide_aliases_1"/>

  In the context of CS, the sparsity of an alias is important. In a
  1-sparse problem (such as the polynomial riddle) 1-sparse aliases
  must be avoided, but 2-sparse aliases are of no concern.

  For example, say we project onto the plane orthogonal to the $b_1$
  axis, and then consider
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_aliases_1">just that
  plane</span>.  The coordinates of the three
  $\mathcal{SB}$-projections are $a_0=[1~1]^T$, $a_1=[-1~2]^T$ and
  $a_2=[1~4]^T$ for the line, constant and parabola respectively.  If
  our (1-sparse) signal has a projection $\alpha a_0$ (i.e., it is a
  constant with value $\alpha$), then a 1-sparse alias exists if we
  can find a solution to $$ \alpha a_0 = \beta a_1 + \gamma a_2 $$
  with either $\beta=0$ or $\gamma=0$.  That is, there is a 1-sparse
  alias if the second or third $\mathcal{SB}$-projection aligns with
  the first.

  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_aliases_1">By inspection of
    the $\mathcal{SB}$-projections</span> we see no two align, and
  there clearly can be no 1-sparse aliases.  We need *both* $\beta
  \neq 0$ AND $\gamma \neq 0$ to satisfy the above equation (i.e., a
  2-sparse alias).

  To phrase this in a way that generalizes to higher dimensions,
  rewrite the above equation as

  $$ \alpha a_0 + (-\beta) a_1 + (-\gamma) a_2=0 $$

  Now the question is slightly different: what combinations of the
  $\mathcal{SB}$-projections add to zero? (You may already see where
  we are heading---combinations of vectors that add to zero are
  __dependent__.).  More specifically, if we take a step $\alpha a_0$
  away from the origin, how many *other* $\mathcal{SB}$-projections do
  we need to get back?  If the answer is "one" there is a 1-sparse
  alias (either $\beta a_1$ or $\gamma a_2$).  If the answer is "two"
  there cannot be a 1-sparse alias (there is merely a 2-sparse alias).

  And so we reach the crux. For the polynomial riddle we require that
  the smallest number of dependent $\mathcal{SB}$-projections is three
  (one projection away from the origin, two projections to return).
  Indeed, this is true for 1-sparse CS in any dimension.

  The extension to $K$-sparse signals is straightforward: if we take 
  <span class="pz_text" ref="K_steps_note">$K$ $\mathcal{SB}$-projection steps</span> 
  away from the origin, it *must* take at least $K+1$ steps to return.
  <span class="pz_text" ref="dependent_steps_note">Thus, in general,
    CS is possible in any dimension if *the smallest number of
    dependent $\mathcal{SB}$-projections is $2K+1$*</span>.  That is,
  with $K$ steps away from the origin it must take at least $K+1$
  steps to return.

  <div class="pz_note" id="K_steps_note">
    We care about the direction of these steps, but not the magnitude.
  </div>

  <div class="pz_note" id="dependent_steps_note">
    That is, if no linear combination with fewer than $K+1$
    $\mathcal{SB}$-projections can add to zero.
  </div>

  In matrix terms, if we write $A=[a_0~a_1~a_2]$ (assembling the
  $\mathcal{SB}$-projections into the columns of $A$) then

  $$ A=\begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 4 \end{bmatrix} $$

  and we require the minimum number of dependent columns (the
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spark_(mathematics),spark] of $A$) to
  be three.  In general, if we express the $\mathcal{SB}$-projections
  as the columns of a matrix, the spark of that matrix should be at
  least $2K+1$ for CS.  As we are about to see, $A$ forms the key CS
  equation.

  <h2 class="pz_section" id="key_equation" 
      ref="slide_key_equation">Key Equation</h2>

  The key equation for CS is an
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underdetermined_system, under
  determined system of linear equations], $$Ax=b$$ As above, $A$ is
  formed from the coordinates of the $\mathcal{SB}$-projections.  In
  general $A$ has $M$ rows and $N$ columns, where $M$ is the dimension
  of the subspace we project into and $N$ is the number of sparsity
  basis terms.

  To derive $Ax=b$ let the $\mathcal{SB}$-projections be represented
  by columns $a_0,a_1,...,a_N$---one for each of the $N$ sparsity
  basis vectors.
  <span class="pz_text" ref="Axb_note">If the sparsity basis
    coordinates of our signal are $[x_0~x_1...x_N]^T$ (with only $K$
    non-zero), then the coordinates of the signal's projection (i.e.,
    the __compressed__ coordinates) are $b$</span>, where: $$
  \begin{bmatrix}a_0&...&a_N\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x_0\\ \vdots
  \\x_N \end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix}b_0\\ \vdots \\b_M
  \end{bmatrix} $$ With the obvious definitions we have $Ax=b$.

  <div class="pz_note" id="Axb_note">
    Recall that $Ax$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$.
    Since the columns of $A$ are the projections of the sparsity basis
    vectors, and $x$ are the weights of the basis vectors in the
    signal, $Ax$ is the projection of the signal.
  </div>

  Even though $A$ has fewer rows than columns we have seen that it is
  possible to solve for $x$ with known sparsity---to recover the
  original signal---so long as the columns of $A$ satisfy a certain
  aliasing constraint.  That is, that no fewer than $2K+1$ columns of
  $A$ can combine to zero.  However, the actual method of
  reconstruction we used---searching over all possible combinations of
  $K$ $\mathcal{SB}$-projections---quickly becomes infeasible as $N$
  and $K$ increase.

  <h2 class="pz_section" id="reconstruction" 
      ref="slide_reconstruction_1">Practical Reconstruction</h2>

  Our approach to reconstruction has been simplistic---essentially
  searching over all possible $\mathcal{SB}$-projections to find a
  match.  While this is adequate for the polynomial riddle it soon
  becomes impossible as the size of our problems grow. We need a
  better idea.

  Let's first consider the
  <span class="pz_text" ref="matrix_riddle_note">matrix form of our
    polynomial riddle</span> ($Ax=b$),

  $$ 
  \begin{bmatrix} 1 & -1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2  & 4 \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \\ x_2 \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
  $$

  Its easy to confirm that the solution is a parabola ($x=[0~0~1]^T$), but 
  <span class="pz_text" ref="algorithm_note">what algorithm</span>
  should we use to solve for $x$?  A __general__ (i.e., not sparse)
  solution is a line, and
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%E2%80%93Penrose_pseudoinverse#Obtaining_all_solutions_of_a_linear_system,
  easy to find].  Basically, we seek the intersection of two planes:
  $$ \begin{align} x_0-x_1+x_2&=1 \nonumber \\ x_0+2x_1+4x_2&=4
  \nonumber \end{align} $$

  <div class="pz_note" id="matrix_riddle_note">
    Assuming we project on the plane orthogonal to the $b_1$ axis.
  </div>

  <div class="pz_note" id="algorithm_note">
    Because computers can execute algorithms.
  </div>

  Our challenge is to find the particular solution on the line that is
  1-sparse.  While we could continue to work in sensing coordinates,
  it is __much__ more straightforward to switch to sparsity
  coordinates, where the coefficients of each sparsity basis term
  claim an axis.  So, for instance, for $f(t)=x_0+x_1t+x_2t^2$ our
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_reconstruction_1">three axes
    are labeled $x_0$, $x_1$ and $x_2$</span>.  These coordinates are
  helpful because a 1-sparse signal is any point on one of the
  axes---and nowhere else.

  <pzthumb src="./python/recon1_3.svg" ref="slide_reconstruction_3"/>

  The sparse solution is thus where the line (the 
  <span class="pz_slide_link"
	ref="slide_reconstruction_2">intersection of two
    planes</span>), itself
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_reconstruction_3">intersects
    an axis</span>.  The solution is at once conceptually simple and
  computationally diabolical.  Imagine traversing the line of
  intersection and evaluating the sparsity (the number of non-zero
  coordinates) at every point.  Almost everywhere the sparsity is
  three (none of the coordinates are zero)---except *at a single
  point*, where $x$ is 1-sparse.

  Yet, there is a hint of a solution if we think in terms of
  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics), norms].  There are
  many ways to mathematically assign a "length" to a vector.  As
  examples: the $\ell_0$ norm counts the number of nonzero
  coefficients (i.e., the sparsity), the $\ell_1$ norm adds the
  magnitudes of the coefficients, the $\ell_2$ norm is the
  root-mean-square of the coefficients, and the $\ell_\infty$ is the
  maximum absolute value of the coefficients.  Minimizing the sparsity
  is the same as minimizing the $l_0$ norm---so perhaps another norm
  can be used in its place?

  Let's <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_reconstruction_4">evaluate 
    several norms</span> as we traverse
  <span class="pz_slide_link" ref="slide_reconstruction_2">the line of
  possible solutions</span>.  The horizontal axis, $d$, is the
  distance along the line from the optimum 1-sparse solution.  Thus,
  as a reference, the $\ell_0$ norm dips to indicate the optimum point
  at $d=0$ (where $x$ is 1-sparse, and so $||x||_0=1$).
  <pzthumb src="./python/norms.svg" ref="slide_reconstruction_4"/> The
  $\ell_2$ norm is the best behaved---a smooth parabola that we could
  easily optimize computationally---but *its minimum does not
  correspond to the sparse solution.* The $\ell_1$ norm is something
  of a compromise---better behaved than the $\ell_0$ norm, not as nice
  as the $\ell_2$ norm, but still indicating the sparse solution at
  its minimum.

  In fact, <span class="pz_text" ref="subject_to_note">minimization of
    the $\ell_1$ norm subject to linear constraints</span> (like
  $Ax=b$) is well understood and efficient and is thus a practical
  means to compute the reconstruction of signals in CS.  We
  essentially exchanged an intractable search for a computationally
  efficient *optimization* problem.

  <h2 class="pz_section" id="extensions" 
      ref="slide_extensions">Summary and Extensions</h2>

  A change of basis (i.e., a change of coordinate system) is the heart
  of CS.  We start with a basis in which the signal is sparse and move
  to a basis in which the signal can be reconstructed from a
  projection onto a subspace.  This means the coefficients that don't
  belong to the subspace are redundant, and we may drop them to find
  compressed coordinates for the signal.

  The key to reconstruction is ensuring that every signal of the
  correct sparsity has its own unique projection.  If two K-sparse
  signals share a projection we say they are K-sparse aliases.
  K-sparse aliases can be avoided by enforcing a constraint on the
  projections of the sparsity basis (the $\mathcal{SB}$-projections).
  If no fewer than $2K+1$ $\mathcal{SB}$-projections can be linearly
  combined to sum to zero then a K-sparse signal's projection is
  guaranteed to be unique, and the signal can thus be reconstructed
  from the compressed coordinates.

  Reconstruction is neatly summarized as seeking a solution to the
  under determined linear equation $Ax=b$.  Here the columns of $A$
  are formed from the $\mathcal{SB}$-projections, $x$ is the sparsity
  coordinates, and $b$ is the compressed coordinates.  The equation
  has many solutions, but only one with the correct sparsity.
  Computationally though, we seek the $x$ with the least $\ell_1$
  norm.

  Since a change of basis is a common approach to compression we might
  well ask what is unique about CS.  The difference is that CS
  compresses the signal __as it is measured__---as opposed to
  digesting the entire signal as a block.  In the polynomial riddle,
  other approaches may measure all three samples, change basis, then
  drop coefficients from the new basis.  With CS we do not need to
  measure the samples that we know we will ultimately drop---in a
  manner of speaking the compression and the sensing are combined.

  This difference---between conventional compression and compressive
  sensing---is more apparent as we consider increasingly realistic
  problems.  The companion module
  <a href="/?id=b0080" target="_blank">Compressive Sensing Primer</a>
  is a bridge to such problems and addresses areas such as:
  <ul>
    <li> the relationship between the two bases; </li>
    <li> uniform sampling (i.e., if you can't pick and choose sampling instants);</li>
    <li> the signal class (periodic signals for example);</li>
    <li> the effect of noise;</li>
    <li> choosing bases for large-scale applications;</li>
    <li> computational tools.</li>
  </ul>
